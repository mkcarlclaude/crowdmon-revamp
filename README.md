# Crowdmon 2026

A self-improving object-detector platform, operated as a live demonstration of cheap,
healthy, observable infrastructure.

**Infrastructure is the deliverable.** The ML flywheel — bootstrap labels with a
zero-shot model, have humans verify the long tail, distil a real-time detector that runs
in the browser — is the workload that generates signal worth observing.

> **Status: not started.** This repository currently contains the design record and
> delivery plan only. No application code exists yet; milestone M1 builds the skeleton.

## Documents

| Document | What it is |
|---|---|
| [`PRD.md`](PRD.md) | v1 scope, the done-claim, eight falsifiable success criteria, non-functional requirements, known risks |
| [`CONTEXT.md`](CONTEXT.md) | Design record — every locked decision with rationale, the options rejected and why, open items, notes on the 2023 codebase |
| [`ROADMAP.md`](ROADMAP.md) | Nine milestones, 39 issues with acceptance criteria |

Work is tracked in [issues](https://github.com/mkcarlclaude/crowdmon-revamp/issues):
[#1](https://github.com/mkcarlclaude/crowdmon-revamp/issues/1) is the PRD epic, and each
milestone below is a tracking issue whose sub-issues are its tasks.

## The v1 done-claim

> A YouTube URL goes in, extraction is visibly running, OTel has data, and images land in R2.

Falsifiable. Everything in v1 serves this sentence; everything that does not is v2. The
entire ML side is deliberately excluded from v1.

## Architecture

Pull topology. The home worker claims jobs from a D1-backed queue over an HTTP endpoint,
runs them, uploads to R2 and posts metadata back. No inbound ports, no dependency on the
house being up — jobs queue harmlessly while home is offline.

```
YouTube ──► Go worker (home Ubuntu)          Cloudflare (free tier)
              │  yt-dlp ─► ffmpeg ─► pHash    ┌──────────────────────┐
              │                               │ Workers + Hono API   │
              ├── long-poll claim ────────────┤ D1  (queue+metadata) │
              ├── heartbeat ──────────────────┤ R2  (frames)         │
              └── upload + complete ──────────┤ Pages (React admin)  │
                                              └──────────────────────┘
              └── OTLP/HTTP ─► collector ─► Tempo / Prometheus / Grafana
                               (via cloudflared tunnel, gated by Access)
```

| Concern | Choice | Why |
|---|---|---|
| Frame extraction | Home Ubuntu box | A household IP dodges YouTube's datacenter block |
| Web runtime | Workers + Hono, React SPA on Pages | Free tier, edge, survives home downtime |
| Metadata + queue | D1 | Free tier rules out Cloudflare Queues; the queue is a table with heartbeat leases |
| Object storage | R2 | Free tier, no egress fees |
| API contract | `@hono/zod-openapi` → OpenAPI → oapi-codegen | Two runtimes must agree; hand-written types on both sides is what broke the 2023 code |
| Infrastructure | Terraform (account resources), wrangler (code + secrets) | The account must be reconstructible from nothing |
| Observability | OpenTelemetry → self-hosted Tempo/Prometheus/Grafana | With no user-facing frontend in v1, Grafana *is* the UI |
| Training | Manual, batch, on Kaggle | No GPU worth training on at home — auto-retrain is ruled out by physics, not preference |

## Planned layout

Created by [M1.1](https://github.com/mkcarlclaude/crowdmon-revamp/issues/11); nothing
below exists yet.

```
apps/api/     Cloudflare Worker — Hono API, D1 queue, OpenAPI spec
apps/web/     React SPA on Pages — admin dashboard
worker/       Go module — yt-dlp download, ffmpeg extraction, pHash dedup
infra/        Terraform — D1, R2, DNS, tunnel, Access apps and policies
```

## Milestones

Each is independently shippable and a valid stopping point. The project is open-ended by
choice, so no milestone depends on finishing the next one to be worth having.

| | Milestone | Done when |
|---|---|---|
| [M1](https://github.com/mkcarlclaude/crowdmon-revamp/issues/2) | Foundations | `terraform apply` provisions D1 and R2 from an empty account, and a hello-world Worker is live via CI |
| [M2](https://github.com/mkcarlclaude/crowdmon-revamp/issues/3) | Observability spine | A span emitted by the hello-world Worker is visible in Tempo |
| [M3](https://github.com/mkcarlclaude/crowdmon-revamp/issues/4) | Contract and queue | curl submits a URL, a job row appears, and curl can claim it |
| [M4](https://github.com/mkcarlclaude/crowdmon-revamp/issues/5) | Worker skeleton | Submitting a URL results in the home worker claiming and completing it |
| [M5](https://github.com/mkcarlclaude/crowdmon-revamp/issues/6) | Admin dashboard | A URL can be submitted from the browser and job status updates live |
| [M6](https://github.com/mkcarlclaude/crowdmon-revamp/issues/7) | Failure semantics | Killing the worker mid-job produces a visible reap and retry |
| [M7](https://github.com/mkcarlclaude/crowdmon-revamp/issues/8) | Download and fan-out | Submitting a URL produces chunk rows covering the whole video |
| [M8](https://github.com/mkcarlclaude/crowdmon-revamp/issues/9) | Chunk extraction | Images are in R2 and rows are in D1, visibly deduplicated |
| [M9](https://github.com/mkcarlclaude/crowdmon-revamp/issues/10) | Close v1 | All eight success criteria in `PRD.md` §5 verified against a real run |

Observability is milestone 2, before there is anything complex to instrument — deferring
instrumentation until it never lands is a named risk.

## Constraints

- **Free tier only.** Any decision requiring a paid plan is out of scope by definition.
- **Cloud survives home downtime.** Home is never a synchronous dependency.
- **Idle polling stays inside the 100,000/day Workers free tier.** Adaptive backoff,
  ~1,000 requests/day idle.
- **Every `/api/admin/*` endpoint independently verifies the caller.** The admin bundle
  is assumed public.

## History

Crowdmon (2023) was a crowdsourced annotation platform for building a labelled image
dataset of Genshin Impact characters. It reached a working vertical slice and stalled:
three loosely-coupled repos, no tests, no CI, no IaC, and an ingestion orchestrator that
never existed in code.

The original premise is now obsolete — open-vocabulary detectors can box a named
character from a text prompt with no training, so "humans must draw every box" no longer
holds. The modern framing that makes the ML side defensible: zero-shot bootstraps the
labels, humans verify and handle the long tail, and the shipped artifact is a distilled
real-time model the foundation model cannot be.

images live in R2 — and republishing frames at scale is deliberately out of scope.
